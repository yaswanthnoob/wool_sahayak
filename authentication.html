										<h2>USER AUTHENTICATION</h2>
									</header>

									<p>User authentication on a website is the process by which a user's identity is confirmed before granting access to specific areas or features. Users typically provide a unique identifier, such as a username or email, and a corresponding password. The website's system then verifies these credentials against stored data, often employing encryption techniques to secure this information. Successful authentication results in access to the user's account or authorized resources, often facilitated by session management to eliminate the need for repeated login during a session. Password policies, account lockout mechanisms, and recovery options enhance security, while multi-factor authentication may offer an extra layer of protection. This process ensures that only authorized individuals can access their accounts and sensitive website content, preserving data security and user privacy.</p>
									<p>Login functionality is highly useful as it ensures the security of user accounts and sensitive information on websites and applications. By verifying a user's identity through credentials like usernames and passwords, it safeguards against unauthorized access. This process allows for personalized user experiences and access control, ensuring that individuals can access only the content and features they are authorized to use, thereby protecting data privacy and enhancing overall security.

									<h2>USER LOGIN</h2>
									<p>User login on a website often encompasses both sign-up and login functionalities, catering to both buyers and sellers.</p>
									<p><h4>Signup:</h4> The signup process allows new users, whether they intend to buy or sell, to create accounts by providing essential information like usernames, email addresses, and passwords. This step is critical as it initiates their journey on the platform, enabling them to access various services. Robust security measures are usually in place to protect user data, such as encrypting and hashing passwords for safe storage.</p>
									<p><h4>Login:</h4> Once users have registered, they can conveniently log in using their registered credentials. By entering their username and password, buyers and sellers verify their identities to access their accounts, personalized settings, purchase history, and sales listings. The login process is pivotal in ensuring the privacy and security of user information, as well as facilitating smooth interactions on the platform.</p>

									<hr class="major" />

									<h2>Admin Login:</h2>
									<p>Admin login is a separate authentication process, designed for administrators responsible for overseeing the platform, managing users, and maintaining its operations.</p>
									<P><h4>Signup:</h4> Admins are typically created by higher-level administrators or system owners. They are given unique administrative usernames and securely stored passwords during the signup process. This step ensures that only authorized individuals have the power to control and monitor the website.</P>
									<p><h4>Login:</h4> Admins access their accounts through a distinct admin login portal. By entering their specific admin credentials, they are authenticated and granted access to the administrative dashboard. Here, they can manage user accounts, configure system settings, and oversee the platform's functionality. Admin login is crucial for maintaining the integrity and security of the website, ensuring that only authorized personnel can perform high-level administrative tasks.
                                     </p>
